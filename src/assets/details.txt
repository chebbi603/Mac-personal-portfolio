This is Mohamed Ayoub. 
A 21 year old freelancer and tech enthusiast from Tunisia and currently residing in Hungary.

My passion for creating software solutions started back in 2018. I have created different projects for different organizations and companies where I worked on developing mobile applications, websites and robotics projects.

The urge of creating better designs for my apps led me to develop Design skills. My first UX/UI design was published on Dribbble in 2019. I have now over 10000 followers and over 55000 shot views.

I am currently opting for a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science Engineering and studying in the University of Debrecen, Hungary
I am also working as a freelancer on Upwork. I have earned a Top Rated Badge with a 100% Job success rate after working with different clients from different countries.
